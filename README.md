 ## Social Media API

The application allows users to search books using the Google Book API. After a user logs in they are able to save the book they would like to purchase, as well as to remove the books from their library. I was unable to get the books to save and remove.

## Use
* `run npm `To install the dependencies locally,
* `run run develop` To run server and client at the same time

Once the terminal gives you the "server Connected on localhost:3001" you can run the code in insomnia to see if the routes are all working. 

* `Test query and mutations in sandbox to get user id information and to create users`
* `Open website and login using the username and password created in sandbox`
